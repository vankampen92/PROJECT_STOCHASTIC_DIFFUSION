/* 
   This function advances the system one single time step, by changing
   system configuration by one single discrete event.  When 
   the stochastic dynamics is implemented following Gillespie Direct 
   algorithm the exact time at which this occurs is sampled from an exponential
   distribution at a rate that represents the total rate at which the
   system changes configuration at any given time (Stochastic_Rate->Total_Rate).
   When it is implemented using the next reaction method, time increases
   according to the shortest waiting time over all events. These times are 
   sampled from the specific expential distribution associated to each event.  

   This function calls two fundamental functions: Exectute_One_Step() and 
   either Temporal_Dynamics() or Temporal_Dynamics_Update(), where the  
   model-specific stochastic dynamics and rates are defined.
